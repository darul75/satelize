# Satelize [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/satelize.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/satelize) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/satelize.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darul75/satelize)

**Satelize** NodeJS module to retrieve user location information based on IP, combined with expressjs for instance make life easier to get some stuff as latitude/longitude of your visitor.

Inspired and using http://www.telize.com/ service. Free today.

You will find informations there too.

## Why ?

Because ecchymose in the nose. I needed something but on server side.

With expressjs for instance, you can get your request IP, then just need to use this library that will make the call to get user location data.

And it is done.

## Demo

## Install

~~~
npm install satelize
~~~

## Usage

```javascript
var satelize = require('satelize');

// Example retrieve IP from request
// var ip = req.header('x-forwarded-for') || req.connection.remoteAddress;

// then satelize call

satelize.satelize({ip:'46.19.37.108'}, function(err, payload) {
  // if used with expressjs
  // res.send(payload);
  // res.json...
});
```

## Return

~~~ json

    "ip": "46.19.37.108",
